# Homework02_ResponsivePortfolio

This project served as an introduction to the CSS framework, Bootstrap. Screenshots of a pre-made website were provided. The website had three pages, which could be toggled between using a navbar. Nine screenshots were provided -- each of the pages was shown at three different screen widths. The task was to, using bootstrap's documentation provided on its website (see below), to produce a website which, although not necessarily identical, had a similar appearance to that provided. More importantly, the replicated website was to be responsive to changes in screen-width in the same was as demonstrated in the photos, a task which was greatly facilitated by Bootstrap's grid system.
